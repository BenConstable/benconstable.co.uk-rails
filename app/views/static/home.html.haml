        I am a programmer from Brighton, UK. Since completing my BSc Computer
        Science at the University of Sussex I have been working as a web
        developer in various agencies in the Brighton area.
        
        I currently work as a Senior Developer for [3ev](http://3ev.com/), an [award-winning agency](http://www.3ev.com/our-clients/the-chemical-brothers/) based in Hove. Working at 3ev gives me a great platform to improve my skillset and try out a lot of new things.

        I take pride in keeping up with latest technologies. You can find the source for this site [on GitHub](https://github.com/BenConstable/benconstable.co.uk-rails). It runs on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and uses [lots of different things](https://github.com/BenConstable/benconstable.co.uk-rails#whats-used) to work in the most efficient way possible.

        My other passion lies in video games. This harks back to the early days of the N64 (F-Zero X, anyone?), which ensured I was hooked enough to carry on playing incessantly for about 15 years and take a stab at making games myself. I built a [C++ game engine](https://github.com/BenConstable/Sangwin-Game-Engine) for my degree dissertation, and am very interested in building browser-based games using Javascript.

        If you'd like to find out more about me and what I do, have a look at my [CV](#{cv_path}) and [Portfolio](#{portfolio_path}). I can be easily contacted using the details below, and am always open to new opportunities. Feel free to [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/brconstable), I'll happily reciprocate the favour!
