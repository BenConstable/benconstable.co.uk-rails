        I am a programmer from Brighton, UK. Since completing my BSc Computer
        Science at the University of Sussex I have been working as a web
        developer for various agencies in the Brighton area.

        I currently work as a Senior Developer for [3ev](http://3ev.com/), an
        [award-winning agency](http://www.3ev.com/our-clients/the-chemical-brothers/)
        based in Hove. Working at 3ev gives me a great platform to improve my
        skillset and try out a lot of new things.

        I take pride in keeping up with latest technologies. You can find the
        source for this site [on GitHub](https://github.com/BenConstable/benconstable.co.uk-rails).
        It runs on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and uses
        [lots of other things](https://github.com/BenConstable/benconstable.co.uk-rails#whats-used).

        My other passion lies in video games. This harks back to the early days
        of the N64 (F-Zero X, anyone?), which ensured I was hooked enough to
        carry on playing incessantly for about 15 years and take a stab at
        making games myself. I built a [C++ game engine](https://github.com/BenConstable/Sangwin-Game-Engine) for my degree dissertation, and am looking to build on it in the future.

        If you'd like to find out more about me and what I do, have a look at my
        [CV](#{cv_path}) and [Github profile](https://github.com/BenConstable). I can be easily
        contacted using the details below, and am always open to new opportunities.
        Feel free to [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/brconstable),
        I'll happily reciprocate the favour!
